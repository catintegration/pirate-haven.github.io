This is a basic guide to start your journey on video game piracy! Starting at trusted sites, game installtion, and an explanation on why direct downloading games is popular and accessible.

## Client Install
QBittorent is an open source bittorrent client. To install it, navigate to [qbittorrent.org](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) and proceed using the installer

## VPN Install
There are many trustworthy vpn's and we will be using NordVPN in this guide

Head over to [nordvpn.com](https://nordvpn.com/download/) click install for windows and follow the installation process. You can gain an account through [hgen](https://www.h-gen.xyz/).

## Piracy Sites + Guide
There are a lot of torrent trackers, but today we will focus on 1337x as it is a general tracker. Go over to 1337x.to and search what you want and I would suggest clicking the one with the most seeders. Next, click "magnet download" and it should prompt to open your qbittorrent . Then you want to chose where you want to choose the download directory and let it finish downloading.

> *Exceptions*: Do not use 1337 for most software or games! Head over to our resources page for specialized trackers.

## Seeding
Many newbies to piracy won't know what seeding is and why it's so praised in the community. Torrents are used instead of the file being downloaded from 1 source(ddl). When someone releases a torrent it will rely on you who has the file to help share that file via p2p (peer 2 peer). This is how corporations can't get rid of torrents as there is no centralized source. However, if a torrent has no seeders, you cannot download that torrent as there is no one hosting that file anymore, the more seeders there are the faster a torrent will be (to a certain extent).

## Conclusion
You always want your VPN to be on while you are torrenting.
